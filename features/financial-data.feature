Feature: Financial Data
  As a User
  I want to to view financial data about a company
  So I can use this information to make a decision

  # Notes:
  # Stock price is probably only useful if paired with
  # - currency
  # - date/time of the price (as-of)

  @automate
  Scenario: A stock price is available for a company

  @todo
  Scenario: A stock price is unavailable for a company
